## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Product Service**: Core product data management
2. **Search Service**: Elasticsearch-powered search and recommendations
3. **Inventory Service**: Real-time stock management
4. **Recommendation Engine**: AI-powered product suggestions
5. **Image Service**: Product image management and optimization

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch with AI embeddings
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Next.js
- **AI**: OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- **Infrastructure**: AWS with Kubernetes, CloudFront CDN

### Data Flow
```
Customer Request → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Product Service
                                              ↓
Search Service ← Elasticsearch ← AI Embeddings ← Product Data
                                              ↓
Response ← Cache Layer ← Recommendation Engine ← User Behavior
```

## Dependencies
- **External**: Product data feed from suppliers (API integration)
- **Internal**: User authentication service (AUTH-EPIC-001)
- **Infrastructure**: Elasticsearch cluster setup (INFRA-EPIC-002)
- **Design**: Product catalog design system (DESIGN-EPIC-001)

## Risk Management
- **Risk**: Search performance degradation at scale
  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive performance testing, caching strategy
- **Risk**: AI recommendation accuracy issues
  **Mitigation**: A/B testing, feedback loops, fallback mechanisms
- **Risk**: Product data quality problems
  **Mitigation**: Data validation pipelines, quality monitoring
