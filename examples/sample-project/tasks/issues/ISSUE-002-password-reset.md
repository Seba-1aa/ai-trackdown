# Implement secure password reset and recovery system

## Description
Create a secure password reset flow that allows users to recover their accounts via email verification while maintaining high security standards and preventing abuse.

## Problem Statement
Users need a reliable way to reset their passwords when they forget them, but the system must be secure against common attacks like email enumeration, brute force attempts, and token replay attacks.

## Success Criteria
- Secure password reset reduces support tickets by 70%
- Reset flow completion rate > 85%
- Zero successful password reset attacks during testing
- Full compliance with OWASP password reset guidelines

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email-based password reset request with rate limiting
- [ ] Secure token generation with expiration (15-minute window)
- [ ] Email delivery with clear instructions and branded template
- [x] Token validation with single-use enforcement
- [ ] New password form with strength requirements
- [ ] Audit logging for all reset attempts and completions
- [ ] Rate limiting: max 3 requests per email per hour
- [ ] Anti-enumeration: same response for valid/invalid emails

## User Stories
- **As a customer**, I want to reset my password via email so that I can regain access to my account quickly
- **As a security admin**, I want to monitor password reset attempts so that I can detect potential attacks
- **As customer support**, I want users to self-serve password resets so that we can focus on complex issues

## Technical Requirements
Implement a secure password reset system following security best practices and industry standards.

### Architecture Impact
- New password reset endpoints in auth service
- Email service integration for reset notifications
- Database schema for reset tokens
- Frontend reset flow components

### Performance Requirements
- Reset token generation: < 100ms
- Email delivery: < 5 seconds
- Token validation: < 50ms
- Support 1000 concurrent reset requests

### Security Considerations
- Cryptographically secure token generation
- Time-based token expiration
- Single-use token enforcement
- Rate limiting per IP and email
- No email enumeration vulnerabilities
- Secure password strength validation

### Dependencies
- Email service (SendGrid/AWS SES)
- Redis for token storage and rate limiting
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Frontend password strength validator

## Implementation Approach
Use time-limited, cryptographically secure tokens stored in Redis with automatic expiration and single-use enforcement.

### Breakdown into Tasks
- [x] [TASK-005] - Design password reset API endpoints
- [ ] [TASK-006] - Implement token generation and storage
- [ ] [TASK-007] - Create email templates and delivery system
- [ ] [TASK-008] - Build password reset frontend components
- [ ] [TASK-009] - Add rate limiting and security controls
- [ ] [TASK-010] - Implement audit logging
- [ ] [TASK-011] - Write comprehensive tests

## Token Context
<!-- AI_CONTEXT_START -->
This issue implements secure password reset functionality for the e-commerce authentication system. The implementation must prevent common vulnerabilities including email enumeration, token replay attacks, and brute force attempts.

Key files and components:
- `src/auth/password-reset.js` - Core password reset logic
- `src/services/email-service.js` - Email delivery service
- `src/middleware/rate-limit.js` - Rate limiting middleware
- `src/components/PasswordReset.jsx` - Frontend reset components
- `templates/password-reset-email.html` - Email template
- `tests/auth/password-reset.test.js` - Test suite

Security requirements:
- Tokens must be cryptographically random (crypto.randomBytes)
- 15-minute expiration window
- Single-use enforcement
- Rate limiting: 3 requests per email per hour
- Constant-time response for valid/invalid emails
- Comprehensive audit logging

Implementation follows OWASP guidelines and includes protection against timing attacks, email enumeration, and token prediction attacks.

## Activity Log
- 2025-01-03T10:15:00Z: Created by @bob
- 2025-01-03T14:30:00Z: Claude analyzed security requirements (tokens: 847)
- 2025-01-04T09:00:00Z: Started implementation work
- 2025-01-05T11:15:00Z: Completed token validation logic (tokens: 634)
- 2025-01-06T16:20:00Z: Code review with @alice - security improvements
- 2025-01-07T10:30:00Z: Copilot assisted with email template generation (tokens: 893)
- 2025-01-07T16:45:00Z: Updated status after completing token validation

## Comments

### Security Review Notes (2025-01-06)
@alice reviewed the implementation and suggested:
- Use constant-time comparison for token validation
- Add additional entropy to token generation
- Implement proper cleanup of expired tokens
- Consider adding CAPTCHA for repeated failed attempts

### Implementation Notes
Current approach uses Redis with automatic expiration for token storage. Each token is 32 bytes of cryptographically secure random data, base64url encoded for URL safety.

Rate limiting implemented using sliding window approach in Redis to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate users to retry.

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all password reset functions
- Integration tests for email delivery
- Security tests for timing attacks and enumeration
- Load tests for rate limiting effectiveness
- Penetration testing for overall flow security
