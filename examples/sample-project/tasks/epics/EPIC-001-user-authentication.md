# User Authentication and Authorization System

## Vision Statement
Create a secure, scalable authentication system that supports multiple auth methods and provides a seamless user experience for our e-commerce platform.

## Business Context
A robust authentication system is foundational for our e-commerce platform, enabling secure user management, personalized experiences, and compliance with security standards.

### Success Metrics
- **User Registration Conversion:** 85% completion rate
- **Login Success Rate:** 99.5% (excluding invalid credentials)
- **Authentication Response Time:** < 200ms for login verification
- **Security Compliance:** Pass all OWASP security audit requirements

### Business Value
- **Revenue Impact:** Enable personalized shopping experiences (+15% conversion)
- **Cost Savings:** Reduce support tickets for password issues by 70%
- **User Value:** Seamless login across devices and social platforms
- **Strategic Value:** Foundation for recommendation engine and user analytics

## Scope and Requirements

### In Scope
- Email/password authentication with secure password policies
- OAuth2 integration (Google, Facebook, Apple Sign-In)
- Multi-factor authentication (SMS, authenticator apps)
- Session management with secure token handling
- Role-based access control (customer, admin, support)
- Password reset and account recovery flows

### Out of Scope
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for enterprise customers (future epic)
- Biometric authentication (future consideration)
- Account linking/merging (future epic)

### Constraints
- **Technical:** Must integrate with existing user database schema
- **Timeline:** Core auth must be complete before Q1 marketing campaign
- **Resources:** Two senior developers, one security specialist
- **Compliance:** GDPR compliance for EU users, CCPA for California users

## Architecture Overview
The authentication system uses JWT tokens for stateless authentication, Redis for session storage, and a microservice architecture pattern for scalability.

### Key Components
- **Auth Service:** Core authentication logic and token management
- **User Service:** User profile management and preferences
- **Session Service:** Session tracking and validation
- **Security Service:** Rate limiting, fraud detection, audit logging

### Integration Points
- Frontend React application
- Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- Admin dashboard
- Customer support tools
- Analytics and tracking systems

## Implementation Strategy

### Phases
1. **Phase 1 - Core Authentication** (3 weeks)
   - Basic email/password login
   - JWT token implementation
   - Password reset functionality

2. **Phase 2 - OAuth Integration** (2 weeks)
   - Google OAuth2 implementation
   - Facebook Login integration
   - Apple Sign-In support

3. **Phase 3 - Enhanced Security** (2 weeks)
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Rate limiting and fraud detection
   - Security audit and testing

### Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| OAuth provider API changes | Medium | Low | Use stable OAuth libraries, implement fallbacks |
| Performance issues at scale | High | Medium | Load testing, caching strategy, monitoring |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security review, penetration testing |
| Third-party service outages | Medium | Medium | Graceful degradation, status monitoring |

|-------|-------------|------|-------------------|
| Claude | 12847 | $0.35 | Requirements analysis, code review |
| GPT-4 | 4200 | $0.18 | Architecture design |
| Copilot | 1500 | $0.03 | Code generation assistance |

### Top Token Consumers
1. **ISSUE-001:** 8247 tokens (comprehensive implementation planning)
2. **ISSUE-003:** 4200 tokens (OAuth architecture design)
3. **ISSUE-002:** 3100 tokens (security analysis)

## Dependencies

### Upstream Dependencies
- **Infrastructure:** Redis cluster setup (DevOps team)
- **Legal:** Privacy policy updates for OAuth (Legal team)

### Downstream Impact
- **User Profile Epic:** Requires auth tokens for API access
- **Recommendation Engine:** Needs user identification
- **Analytics Platform:** Requires user session tracking

## Token Context
<!-- AI_CONTEXT_START -->
This epic implements the core authentication system for the e-commerce platform. Key architectural decisions include JWT for stateless auth, Redis for session management, and OAuth2 for social login.

Critical files:
- `src/auth/` - Core authentication logic
- `src/services/auth-service.js` - Main auth service
- `src/middleware/auth.js` - Express auth middleware
- `src/components/auth/` - Frontend auth components
- `config/oauth.js` - OAuth provider configuration

The system prioritizes security and performance, with comprehensive rate limiting, input validation, and secure token handling. All authentication flows must pass security audit before deployment.

Testing requirements include unit tests for all auth logic, integration tests for OAuth flows, and load testing for session management.
