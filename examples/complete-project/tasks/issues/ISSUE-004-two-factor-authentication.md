## Current Status: BLOCKED

### Blocking Issues

#### 1. Security Audit Approval (High Priority)
**Blocker**: Corporate Security Team Audit  
**Created**: 2025-01-05T14:00:00Z  
**Status**: Waiting for security team availability  
**Expected Resolution**: 2025-01-12T17:00:00Z  

**Details**:
- Required: Comprehensive security review of 2FA implementation design
- Scope: TOTP algorithm validation, SMS provider security, backup code storage
- Requirements: Penetration testing of 2FA flows
- Impact: Cannot proceed with implementation without security approval
- Contact: @chief-security-officer, @security-architect

**Mitigation Efforts**:
- âœ… Submitted detailed security design document (2025-01-05)
- âœ… Provided threat modeling analysis (2025-01-06)
- ðŸ”„ Scheduled preliminary review meeting (2025-01-09T10:00:00Z)
- ðŸ“‹ Preparing for formal security presentation (2025-01-11T14:00:00Z)

#### 2. SOC 2 Compliance Validation (High Priority)
**Blocker**: Legal/Compliance Team Review  
**Created**: 2025-01-06T10:00:00Z  
**Status**: Compliance requirements analysis in progress  
**Expected Resolution**: 2025-01-15T17:00:00Z  

**Details**:
- Required: SOC 2 Type II control framework compliance validation
- Scope: 2FA controls, audit logging, data protection requirements
- Requirements: Legal review of SMS provider agreements, data retention policies
- Impact: Implementation approach may need modification for compliance
- Contact: @compliance-officer, @legal-counsel

**Compliance Requirements Under Review**:
- User consent mechanisms for SMS 2FA
- Data retention policies for 2FA audit logs
- Third-party vendor assessment (SMS provider)

## Impact Analysis

### Business Impact of Delay
- **Security Risk**: Extended exposure without 2FA protection
- **Compliance Timeline**: SOC 2 certification may be delayed
- **Customer Trust**: Enterprise customers expecting 2FA availability
- **Competitive Position**: Competitors already offer 2FA features

### Technical Impact
- **Epic Dependencies**: EPIC-001 completion delayed
- **Integration Testing**: Cannot validate end-to-end auth flows
- **Sprint Planning**: Team capacity idle waiting for unblock
- **Technical Debt**: May need rushed implementation if delayed too long

### Resource Impact
- **Team Utilization**: @security-team partially idle (3.5 hours invested)
- **Sprint Goals**: Current sprint success metrics at risk
- **Token Budget**: 1,247 tokens used for planning (11% of issue allocation)
- **Timeline Risk**: Original target date of 2025-01-20 now unlikely

## Mitigation Strategies

### Parallel Work Streams
1. **Implementation Preparation**
   - Complete unit test structure
   - Finalize UI/UX designs for 2FA flows
   - Prepare integration test scenarios
   - Document deployment procedures

2. **Alternative Security Measures**
   - Implement enhanced password requirements
   - Add login anomaly detection
   - Strengthen account lockout policies
   - Improve audit logging coverage

3. **Communication Plan**
   - Weekly updates to stakeholders
   - Customer communication about timeline
   - Internal team coordination
   - Escalation to executive level if needed

### Risk Reduction
- **Phased Implementation**: Start with TOTP-only if SMS approval delayed
- **Feature Flags**: Deploy behind flags for gradual rollout
- **Rollback Plan**: Ensure quick rollback capability
- **Alternative Providers**: Pre-approve backup SMS providers
