**Dependencies:**
- React 18 with concurrent features
- Styled Components for CSS-in-JS
- Storybook for component development
- Figma design tokens (automated sync)
- Mobile device testing lab

**Performance Considerations:**
- Code splitting by route and component
- Image optimization with WebP/AVIF
- CSS tree shaking and purging
- Bundle size monitoring (<2MB total)
- Critical CSS inlining

**Responsive Strategy:**
- Mobile-first CSS (min-width media queries)
- Touch-friendly interactive elements (44px minimum)
- Flexible typography with fluid scaling
- Progressive enhancement for larger screens

**Testing Requirements:**
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Device testing (iOS, Android, various screen sizes)
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Performance testing on slow networks
<!-- AI_CONTEXT_END -->

## User Experience Considerations

### Mobile-First Design Principles
1. **Touch First**: All interactive elements optimized for finger navigation
2. **Content Priority**: Essential content visible without scrolling
3. **Performance**: <3s load time on 3G networks
4. **Simplicity**: Reduce cognitive load with clear visual hierarchy
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all users

### Key User Flows
- **Product Discovery**: Search, browse, filter (mobile-optimized)
- **Product Detail**: Gallery, specs, reviews (swipe interactions)
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, edit, checkout (streamlined flow)
- **Account Management**: Profile, orders, settings (simplified navigation)

### Cross-Device Continuity
- **State Persistence**: Shopping cart, preferences across devices
- **Responsive Images**: Optimized for each screen size and resolution
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works on all devices

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Component Library Structure**: Atomic design methodology (2025-01-05)
2. **Styling Solution**: Styled Components over CSS modules (2025-01-04)
3. **Mobile Breakpoints**: 320px base, 768px tablet, 1024px desktop (2025-01-03)

## Performance Targets

### Current Metrics (Mobile)
- **PageSpeed Score**: 67/100 (target: >90)
- **First Contentful Paint**: 3.2s (target: <2.5s)
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 4.8s (target: <2.5s)
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: 0.24 (target: <0.1)
- **Bundle Size**: 3.8MB (target: <2MB)

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based splitting
2. **Image Optimization**: WebP/AVIF with fallbacks, responsive images
3. **CSS Optimization**: Tree shaking, critical CSS, unused code removal
4. **JavaScript Optimization**: Minification, compression, lazy loading
5. **Caching Strategy**: Service worker, CDN, browser cache optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks
- **Design System Complexity**: Comprehensive system may delay delivery
  - Mitigation: Phased approach, MVP component set first
  - Impact: Medium (2-3 week potential delay)

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Modern CSS features support varies
  - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, thorough testing
  - Impact: Medium (feature degradation on older browsers)

### Medium Risks
- **Performance Budget**: Mobile performance targets ambitious
  - Mitigation: Continuous monitoring, performance budgets in CI
  - Impact: Low (may require feature simplification)

- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA requirements comprehensive
  - Mitigation: Accessibility specialist involvement, automated testing
  - Impact: Medium (potential compliance delays)
