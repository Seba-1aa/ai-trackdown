### Token Burn Rate Analysis

**Weekly Token Usage Pattern:**
```
Week 1 (Jan 1-7): 12,847 tokens
  - Epic planning and architecture: 8,934 tokens
  - Implementation start: 3,913 tokens

Week 2 (Jan 8-14): Projected 15,000 tokens
  - Heavy implementation phase
  - OAuth completion, mobile components
  - AI architecture finalization

Week 3 (Jan 15-21): Projected 12,000 tokens  
  - Testing and optimization

  - Focus on AI implementation and polish
```

**Token Efficiency Optimizations:**
- **Code Reuse**: Established patterns reduce token needs for similar components
- **Template Approaches**: Standardized architectures minimize repeated analysis
- **Incremental Development**: Small, focused changes rather than large rewrites
- **Context Caching**: Previous analysis available for follow-up questions

### Risk Management & Mitigation

**Critical Path Risks:**

1. **Two-Factor Authentication Delay** (High Impact)
   - Current Status: Blocked 3 days, security audit pending
   - Business Impact: SOC 2 compliance timeline at risk
   - Mitigation: Parallel OAuth development, executive escalation scheduled
   - Timeline: Expected unblock 2025-01-12, implementation by 2025-01-20

2. **Mobile Component Complexity** (Medium Impact)
   - Current Status: 40% complete, navigation in review
   - Business Impact: Q1 mobile conversion targets at risk
   - Mitigation: Phased rollout, core components prioritized
   - Timeline: MVP components by 2025-01-20, full system by 2025-02-15

3. **AI Infrastructure Provisioning** (Medium Impact)
   - Current Status: Platform setup 30% complete
   - Business Impact: Recommendation engine timeline
   - Mitigation: AWS pre-provisioning, alternative platforms evaluated
   - Timeline: Platform ready by 2025-02-01, models by 2025-03-01

**Token Budget Risks:**
- Current burn rate sustainable at 7,000 tokens/week
- EPIC-003 (AI) allocated 80,000 tokens - largest remaining budget
- Mitigation: Optimize prompts, use smaller models for routine tasks

## Technical Debt & Code Quality

### Current Technical Debt Items

### Architecture Decisions Log

**Recent Decisions (Last 30 Days):**

1. **JWT vs Sessions** (2025-01-05, @alex-dev + Claude analysis)
   - Decision: JWT with Redis blacklist
   - Rationale: Stateless for microservices, better scalability
   - Impact: All authentication endpoints, session storage eliminated
   - Reversibility: High (can implement session fallback)

2. **Mobile-First Design System** (2025-01-06, @ui-team + GPT-4 analysis)
   - Decision: Custom design system vs Material UI
   - Rationale: Brand consistency, performance optimization, flexibility
   - Impact: All frontend components, development velocity
   - Reversibility: Low (significant rework required)

3. **AI Model Architecture** (2025-01-07, @ml-team + Claude analysis)
   - Decision: Hybrid collaborative + content + LLM approach
   - Rationale: Balance accuracy, cost, and cold-start performance
   - Impact: All recommendation features, infrastructure costs
   - Reversibility: Medium (model swapping possible)

4. **OAuth Provider Selection** (2025-01-04, @security-team + GPT-4 analysis)
   - Decision: Google, GitHub, Microsoft in Phase 1
   - Rationale: Cover 85% of user preferences, enterprise requirements
   - Impact: OAuth integration scope, user experience
   - Reversibility: High (providers can be added/removed)

## AI Agent Optimization Strategies

### Token Efficiency Patterns

**High-Efficiency Patterns (Reuse These):**
1. **Incremental Architecture**: Start with interface design, then implementation
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Reference previous similar implementations
3. **Error-First Design**: Design error handling before happy path
4. **Test-Driven Planning**: Define acceptance criteria before implementation

**Token-Heavy Patterns (Use Sparingly):**
1. **Full System Architecture**: Reserve for new epics or major rewrites
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Only for critical security or performance reviews
3. **Alternative Comparison**: Limit to 2-3 options maximum
4. **Complete Code Generation**: Prefer guided implementation over full generation

### Effective AI Prompting for This Project

```

**Code-Specific Prompts:**
```
Good: "Review this React component for accessibility compliance with our 
WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The component is part of our mobile-first design 
system and needs to work with screen readers."

```

**Architecture Prompts:**
```
Good: "Analyze the security implications of storing refresh tokens in our 
existing encrypted PostgreSQL setup vs Redis cache, considering our SOC 2 
compliance requirements and 100k concurrent user target."
