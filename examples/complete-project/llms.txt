## Project Overview
ShopFlow E-commerce Platform Enhancement using ai-trackdown methodology
Active development: Mobile-first redesign, modern authentication, AI recommendations
Team size: 12 developers, 3 AI agents (Claude, GPT-4, Copilot)
Duration: January 1 - March 15, 2025 (11 weeks)

## Key Files & Structure
/TASKTRACK.md: Project dashboard with status, metrics, team activity
/tasks/epics/: 3 major epics with business value and technical details
/tasks/issues/: 7 active issues across different development phases
/tasks/tasks/: 15+ granular tasks showing implementation progress

## Current Sprint Status (Sprint 3: Jan 7-20, 2025)
Active Issues: 3 in-progress, 1 in-review, 1 blocked
Token Usage: 49,201 tokens used (27.3% of budget)
Burn Rate: 7,000 tokens/week (on track for 180k total budget)
Team Velocity: 23 story points completed, 37 remaining

## Epic Progress Summary
**EPIC-001: Modern Authentication System** (65% complete)
- Status: In-progress, JWT service completed, OAuth integration 70% done
- Token Budget: 40,000 | Used: 22,847 | Remaining: 17,153
- Key Issues: ISSUE-001 ✅ done, ISSUE-003 🔄 in-progress, ISSUE-004 🚫 blocked

**EPIC-002: Mobile-First UI Redesign** (40% complete) 
- Status: In-progress, design system 60% done, navigation in review
- Token Budget: 60,000 | Used: 18,234 | Remaining: 41,766
- Key Issues: ISSUE-008 🔄 in-progress, ISSUE-009 👀 in-review

**EPIC-003: AI Recommendation Engine** (15% complete)
- Status: Planning phase, architecture designed, data pipeline next
- Token Budget: 80,000 | Used: 8,120 | Remaining: 71,880
- Key Issues: All in planning/design phase

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 integration with Google/GitHub/Microsoft
2. **Mobile UI**: Responsive component library and navigation system
3. **AI Planning**: Recommendation engine architecture and data pipeline
4. **Security**: Two-factor authentication (blocked on security audit)

## AI Agent Activity
**Claude (28 interactions, 28,456 tokens)**: 
- Primary: Architecture analysis, code generation, security review
- Recent: OAuth integration guidance, mobile component implementation
- Strengths: System design, TypeScript interfaces, security patterns

**GPT-4 (15 interactions, 12,837 tokens)**:
- Primary: Technical decisions, performance analysis, compliance review
- Recent: Mobile UX patterns, OAuth security validation
- Strengths: Best practices, architecture review, technical writing

**Copilot (156 suggestions, 6,000 tokens)**:
- Primary: Code completion, syntax suggestions, test generation
- Recent: React component boilerplate, CSS property suggestions
- Strengths: Rapid development, code quality, testing support

## Integration Status
**External Systems:**
- GitHub Issues: ✅ Synced (last: 2025-01-07T15:30:00Z)
- Jira Project: ✅ Synced (last: 2025-01-07T15:00:00Z)  
- Linear Team: ⚠️ Partial sync (auth issues)

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Main branch: Protected, requires 2 reviews + AI agent validation
- Feature branches: Auto-delete after merge, 87% test coverage
- Deployment: Staging auto-deploy, production requires approval

## Recent Activity (Last 24 Hours)
- ISSUE-003: OAuth integration progress, Microsoft provider 90% complete
- ISSUE-009: Mobile navigation completed, pending UX/accessibility review
- TASK-008: Responsive card component 70% done, product cards implemented
- Security: Two-factor auth still blocked pending corporate security audit

## Risk Assessment
**High Priority Risks:**
1. Security audit delay affecting two-factor authentication timeline
2. Mobile design system complexity potentially impacting delivery
3. AI recommendation model performance uncertain with current approach

**Mitigation Status:**
- Security: Parallel OAuth development continuing, escalation to CSO
- Mobile: Phased component delivery, core components completed first
- AI: Baseline model established, performance benchmarking in progress

## Quick Commands
```bash
# View current sprint items
ai-trackdown list --sprint=current --status=active

# Check token usage by epic
ai-trackdown tokens report --by=epic --period=week

# Generate AI context for active work
ai-trackdown context --active-issues --for=claude

# Sync with all external systems
ai-trackdown sync --all --validate

# Create new task in current epic
ai-trackdown create task "Description" --epic=EPIC-001 --estimate=3
```

## For AI Agents: Key Context
**Current Priority**: Complete EPIC-001 authentication system and EPIC-002 mobile components
**Technical Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript, Node.js + Express, PostgreSQL + Redis, AWS infrastructure
**Code Quality**: >90% test coverage required, ESLint + Prettier enforced, security-first approach
**Token Efficiency**: Optimize for cost, prefer incremental development, reuse patterns
**Documentation**: Maintain inline code comments, update API docs, track architectural decisions
