# Core Documentation Framework

## Overview
Establish comprehensive documentation foundation for ai-trackdown open-source release, including all templates, examples, and getting-started materials.

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Complete README.md with compelling value proposition
- ✅ Full template library for all task types
- ✅ Realistic example project demonstration  
- ✅ Self-implementation as proof of concept
- ✅ Ready for open-source community distribution

## Business Value
Enable the AI development community to adopt efficient task management practices with:
- 50% reduction in token usage via context optimization
- 90% reduction in repeated context explanations
- Native AI agent project understanding
- Complete cost transparency for AI development

## Issues
- ✅ Create comprehensive open-source documentation with project rationale
- ✅ Create pure markdown template files (documentation only)
- ✅ Build example project with complete task hierarchy (markdown only)
- ✅ Implement ai-trackdown framework for this project's own tracking
