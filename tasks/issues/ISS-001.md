# Fix interactive init prompt handling for CLI environments

## Description

The `aitrackdown init` command fails in CLI environments with the error:
```
❌ Failed to initialize project: User force closed the prompt with 0 null
```

This occurs when:
1. Running in automated CLI environments
2. Attempting to pipe input (`echo "project-name" | aitrackdown init`)
3. Using non-interactive shells

## Expected Behavior

- Should support non-interactive flags like `--project-name` and `--skip-interactive`
- Should handle stdin input properly for automated setups
- Should gracefully handle CLI environments without interactive prompts

## Current Workaround

Manual creation of tasks directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p tasks/{epics,issues,tasks,templates}
echo '{"projectName": "project-name", "projectType": "Software"}' > tasks/.project.json
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `--project-name` flag support
- [ ] Add `--skip-interactive` flag support  
- [ ] Fix stdin piping for project name input
- [ ] Add proper error handling for non-interactive environments
- [ ] Update CLI help documentation

## Technical Notes

Error occurs in interactive prompt handling when no TTY is available or user input is interrupted.
