# Comment on ISS-0001: Initial Feedback

Great work on the initial implementation! I have a few suggestions for the authentication flow:

1. Consider adding rate limiting to the login endpoint to prevent brute force attacks
2. We should implement proper session timeout handling
3. Would be good to add @security-team for a review of the JWT implementation

The overall architecture looks solid. Once we address these security considerations, we should be good to move forward with testing.
