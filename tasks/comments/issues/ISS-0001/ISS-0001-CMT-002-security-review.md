# Comment on ISS-0001: Security Review

Thanks for tagging us @masa. I've reviewed the JWT implementation and have some recommendations:

## Security Findings

1. **✅ Token Structure**: The JWT token structure looks good with proper claims
2. **⚠️ Token Expiration**: Currently set to 24 hours - recommend reducing to 1 hour with refresh token support
3. **❌ Secret Management**: JWT secret is hardcoded - must move to environment variables
4. **✅ Algorithm**: Using RS256 which is secure

## Recommendations

```javascript
// Example of proper secret management
const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!jwtSecret) {
  throw new Error('JWT_SECRET environment variable must be set');
}
```

I've attached our standard security review checklist for authentication systems. Please address items 3 and 4 before we can approve for production.

@dev-team - Let me know if you need any clarification on the security requirements.
